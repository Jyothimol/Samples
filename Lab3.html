		<p>Tom and Jerry is a series of theatrical musical cartoon shorts created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that centered on a never-ending rivalry between a house cat (Tom) and a mouse (Jerry)  whose chases and battles often involved comic violence. Hanna and Barbera 			
		ultimately wrote and directed one hundred and fourteen Tom and Jerry cartoons at the MGM cartoon studio in Hollywood, California between 1940 and 1957, when the animation unit was closed down. The original series is notable for having won the Academy Awards for Best Short Subject seven times, tying it with Walt Disney's Silly 
		Symphonies as the most-awarded theatrical animated series. The series has also won more Oscars than any other animated series.Beginning in 1960, in addition to the originals, MGM had new shorts produced by Rembrandt Films, led by Gene Deitch in Eastern Europe. Production of Tom and Jerry shorts returned to Hollywood 				
		under Chuck Jones' Sib-Tower 12 Productions in 1963; this series lasted until 1967, making it a total of 161 shorts.</p>
